## Introduction

*A message generator program that outputs a new, random message every time a user runs the program. 
The project can be adapted to different forms, like an astrology generator, 
inspirational messages, fortune tellings, or nonsensical jokes.

The finished iteration functions as a random spell generator, inspired by [Cryptozoic Entertainment's](https://cryptozoic.com/) board game IP [EPIC SPELL WARS](https://cryptozoic.com/products/epicspellwars4_game?_pos=7&_sid=4f27c40fe&_ss=r).*

## Project Objectives:
* Build a message generator program using JavaScript ES6
* Use GitHub version control
* Use Git Bash command line
* Develop it locally

## Technologies needed?

* Javascript ES6

## Launching

* If you wish to edit and customize this code you need a text editor like Visual Studio Code or Notepadd++.
* The easiest way to run the code is to use Visual Studio Code as your text editor and then install a NodeJs extension on the editor, and then run it from there.

## Features

* use the code to randomly generate a message or text. In this iteration it can be used to generate a funny/bizzare name for a random spell.

## Examples of use

On line 15 write a credit card's number that you wish to check (in the following format and save):

```javascript
const credit_card1 = [4 5, 3, 9, 6, 7, 7, 9, 0, 8, 0, 1, 6, 8, 0, 8];
```
Now check the validity of your credit card by saving this code on line 91. The program will return whether the card is valid or invalid card.
```javascript
console.log(validateCred(credit_card1));
```
There are other features that the code provides: listing invalid, valid cards; listing companies with invalid cards...

## Status

Project is: finished!

The project has been finished and no future updates have been planned since the original purpose of the project - to learn javascript and create a program that could randomly generate messages/text.

The project's code can, of course, be incorporated in similar app that needs to generate objects/items randomly or could be used by a company like Cryptozoic Entertainment to digitalise a board game that used random generaton as one of it's mechanics.

Yet, I am always open to code suggestions, etc.
