## Introduction

* The goal of this project was to build a style guide/design system for my website [www.darkfolklore.com](https://darkfolklore.com/). Developers and designers use design systems to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.
* As a website grows larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles will help to stay cohesive and to make the website enjoyable for users! It also helps when working with other developers, as you can have a consistent reference for how my website should be built.

## Right of use

* This project is only published to be used as an example, reference by others. This project can be used as a piece to be inspired by.
* All original content created on my website and this project is secured by copyright law. For example, the use of the "Dark Folklore" logo is not intended for public use by others.

For a work to qualify for copyright, it must be 'original'. This is not an onerous requirement to satisfy. The work does not have to be novel or unique. It just has to originate from the author i.e. it must not be copied but must be created as a result of some skill, labor, and judgment. The work must also be 'recorded in writing or otherwise but the method of fixation is irrelevant and could even include computer memory.

What that means is that even though I can not copyright the color "Depression Cherry", the HTML, CSS and other elements together do create an original piece of work that is protected under copyright law. 

## Status

The project is: finished!

* Even though the project is finished, it will be updated since a website's design never stays the same: re-brandings, third-party product and service changes, etc. might force me to change the design of the site. 
* In the future sections for <table>, <ul>, and other elements might be included.
* Also, I am always open to code and design suggestions, etc.
